Internal Load balancer

If your clients are located in the same VPC network or in a network connected to the cluster's (VPC network), then use an Internal LoadBalancer Service. Internal LoadBalancer Services are implemented by using internal passthrough Network Load Balancers. Clients located in the same VPC network or in a network connected to the cluster's VPC network can access the Service by using the load balancer's IP address.

To create an internal LoadBalancer Service, include one of the following annotations in the metadata.annotations[] of the Service manifest:

networking.gke.io/load-balancer-type: "Internal" (GKE 1.17 and later)
cloud.google.com/load-balancer-type: "Internal" (versions earlier than 1.17)
